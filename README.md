# Extracting-and-Visualizing-Stock-Data
### In this project, I do the following:
1. I use the yfinance library to extract Tesla's stock data, 
2. I use webscraping with the Beautiful Soup library to extract Tesla's and Gamestop's revenue data, 
3. I use the make_graph function to plot their historical shareprice and revenue data.
