# Extracting-and-Visualizing-Stock-Data
### In this project, I do the following:
1. Use the yfinance library to extract Tesla's and Gamestop's stock data
2. Use webscraping with the Beautiful Soup library to extract Tesla's and Gamestop's revenue data
3. Use the make_graph function to plot their historical shareprice and revenue data, and form an analysis
